* 2016-02-15 Performance issues                                  :Lucas:Tais:

Tais report that her solution to DB insertion has severe performance
issues. The initial solution was that every *pop* event become a
insert. That didn't work, so Tais optimize with an alternative
implementation which uses StringBuffer and create many insert commands
on that object. They only get executed at the end of the parsing. Tais
was never capable to evaluate if this solution is faster because
execution runs out of memory.

So, by looking into this SO entry:

+ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11389449/performance-of-mysql-insert-statements-in-java-batch-mode-prepared-statements-v

We propose a new attempt to solve the performance problem. The SO
entry proposes four solutions, we will take the last one, which seems
the best. To correctly adapt this fourth solution to Tais's case, we
should limit the batch size to something acceptable. If not, we will
run out of memory again because the (usual) trace file size is just
too big.

So, next plans are like this:
- Tais will limit the size of the batch considering the number of
  operations on it.
- Each batch will contain five StringBuffers, one for each paje type
  (Container, State, Link, Variable, and Event).
- Every time something gets added to one of these string buffers, the
  operation count of the batch gets increased.
- When the batch size reaches a (configurable) value X, the code
  executes the batch, zero it, and we start again filling.
- Tais will do a quick performance analysis by changing the
  (configurable) value X to see the impact in execution time.

How to know the baseline:
- Find out how long it take to only parse with the Java version. You
  can do that by checking out the *no-db* branch.

How to get it working.

Install mysql, root password should be root:

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
#+end_src

Run the =pajeDB.sql= to create the tables.

Fix =compile.sh= to have the correct CLASSPATH.

Problems found:
- Program does not terminate
- 


_Plugin_:

- Today, SQL commands are created in the middle of the PajeSimulator
  source code. Moreover, the different strategies (searching for
  performance) are commented in the same source code. This leads to
  design that is difficult to manage, and also hard to evaluate the
  different performance options.

- So my suggestion is to create a plugin for each type of output from
  the simulator. You will go back in time so the Paje Simulator source
  code is as clean as possible, and instrument this code to contain
  specific calls when something should be registered (such as the pop,
  the end links, and so on).

- The plugin will be called in this different instrumentation points
  and do what it was design to do. A first plugin to be implemented is
  the one with the SQL insert commands.

- Alternative versions to look for better performance should be
  implemented as other plugins, that could be subclasses (derived)
  from the initial one, if there is some functionality sharing between
  them.

- Plugins already proposed by Tais:
  - Multiple batches, but are handle sequentially
  - Multiple batches, but with threads
  - Print the SQL commands to output

- Class model for this plugin story
  - PajePlugin
    - PajePluginMultipleBatchesSequential
      - PajePluginMultipleBatchesThreads
    - PajePluginPrintSQLCommandsToOutput
    - PajePluginNull
    - PajePluginOutputPJDUMP

- Clean PajeSimulator
  - Create PajePlugin

- Exhaustive list of instrumentations points for the plugins
  - All types and values definitions
  - All create containers
  - Pops
  - Events
  - Add, Sub, Set variables
  - Start and end of links

* 2016-02-28 Starting Aiyra                                            :Tais:
The new implementation with plugins will be called Aiyra.
The code is [[https://github.com/taisbellini/aiyra][here]].
There are only two classes with a print informing which plugin was chosen.

** How to use

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both
java br.ufrgs.inf.tlbellini.PajeGrammar -f <path-to-trace-file> \
                                        -m <comment (optional)> \
                                        -p <plugin (default: null)> \
                                        - ... <options for the specific plugin>
#+end_src

** Plugins available

- "pjdump": it outputs a CSV based on the =pj_dump= format
- "mysql" : saves the data in a MySQL database

** Plugins
PajeDumpPlugin: using System.out.println which is bad in performance,
but I couldn't find other solution that would not giva e heap space
problem to big files. The current solution implies the user to decide
how many lines will be in the dump. The higher the number, better the
performance but more memory is used. In my computer, I have
JavaHeapSpace problem. 


* 2016-02-29 Adding PajeInsertDBPlugin                                 :Tais:
** Notes
-When destroy container: just need to insert states
    - Event: inserts when it happens
    - Var: inserts when it is created or updated
    - Link: inserts when it is complete
* 2016-03-15 How to Use 
** DB Plugin 

1) Install MySQL and MySQL Workbench 

2) Create an instance (local or in a server) and choose a name and password to it. Use port 3306. 

3) execute pajeDB.sql script in the created instance.

Now you have a database called "paje". 

Execute the simulator passing the server name (-s) name (-u) and password (-pwd) of the instance you created in step 2. Defaults are "localhost", "root", "root". 


#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both
java br.ufrgs.inf.tlbellini.PajeGrammar -f <path-to-trace-file> \
                                        -m <comment (optional)> \
                                        -p mysql \
                                        -s <server-name> \
                                        -u <username> \
                                        -pwd <password> \
#+end_src

** PajeDump Plugin

Execute:

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both
java br.ufrgs.inf.tlbellini.PajeGrammar -f <path-to-trace-file> \
                                        -m <comment (optional)> \
                                        -p pjdump \
                                        -l <lines-per-dump (default: 100000)>
#+end_src

"lines-per-dump" is the number of lines that will be printed each time. Higher numbers takes less time but use more memory. 

* 2016-03-15 - How to Create a Plugin
In order to create a new plugin you'll need to: 
MODIFY OptionsHandler.java in br.ufrgs.inf.tlbellini;
CREATE a NEW class in br.ufrgs.inf.tlbellini.plugins that EXTENDS PajePlugin class. It can also extend any other plugin if they have many similarities. 

MODIFY OptionsHandler:
1) *If your plugin DOES NOT NEED an extra argument, SKIP this instruction*

In the OptionsHandler constructor, add the new argument as follows: 
  
   opt.getSet().addOption("<alias>", Options.Separator.<SEPARATOR>, Options.Multiplicity.<MULTIPLICITY>);

   <alias> = the alias to identify the argument
   <SEPARATOR> = COLON, EQUALS, BLANK, NONE
   <MULTIPLICITY> = ONCE, ONCE_OR_MORE, ZERO_OR_ONE, ZERO_OR_MORE

2) Explain your new entry (if any) and plugin in printOptionsHelper() method.
3) In pluginHandler() method, add a "case" to your plugin. Make all the assignments you need to do and initialize it. 
   to get the value given for the argument: 
     opt.getSet().getOption("<alias").getResultValue(0)
   to check if the value was set: 
     opt.getSet().isSet("<alias>")
   to initialize:
     PajeGrammar.plugin = new YourPluginClass(...);

CREATE NEW CLASS: 

1) Create a class that extends PajePlugin or any Plugin available.

  - Software: everything in the same machine

_What we shall measure to evaluate?_

- *Batch size*
  - Input size
    - Lucas will provide a trace file generator
      128K, 128M, 1G
  - Batch size in operations
    - 128

    - 1024
    - 2048
    - ...
  - Four platform configurations
    - _luiza_ Tais' personal notebook (Local/Mac) - Tais
    - _guarani_ Lucas' guarani (Linux/Local) - Lucas
    - _orion_ Orion (Linux/Local) - Tais
    - _hptais_ Tais' work notebook is client (Windows), guarani is server (Linux) (Remote) - Tais
      - Find out the interconnection topology
      - The latency and the bandwidth of the network (limits)
        - Find out a metric to see if you reach the network limit

- What to measure
  - Global execution time
    - Only simulation
    - Only insertion
  - Global memory occupation
  |----------------------+---------------------+--------------------------|
  | Only Simulation Time | Only Insertion Time | Global Memory Occupation |
  |----------------------+---------------------+--------------------------|

  - How batches have been generated
    - When a batch has started, when it has ended
    - Format suggestion for dumping this kind of information
      |--------------+------------+----------+---------------+------------------------------|
      | Batch number | Start time | End time | Size in bytes | Size in number of operations |
      |--------------+------------+----------+---------------+------------------------------|

- *Comparison against C++*
  - Measure only the simulation time
    - Null plugin against
      - =pj_dump= with =-q=
      - =pj_dump= with =-q= and =-f= (for flex)

    - Orion (Local) - Tais
  |----------------------|
  | Only simulation time |
  |----------------------|

_Experimental Design_

- How many replications? 30.
- Statistical framework: gaussian distribution, with mean, sd, se
  - se: =3*sd/sqrt(n)=, CI of 99.7% assuming gaussian
  - no statistical tests (t-test), because we'll use plots to analyze
    with mean+se and mean-se
- See Jain 1991, Part III, Chapter 16.

- _Factors_
  - Input size
    - small, big
  - Batch size
    - small, big
  - Platform
    - two platforms wildly different

- _Real Factors and levels_ (see chapter 23 on page 381)
  - input size: 3
  - batch size: 6
  - platforms: 4
- 3*6*4
  #+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
  input_size = 3;
  batch_levels = 6;
  platforms = 4;
  r=30;
  total_number_of_experiments = input_size*batch_levels*platforms*r
  minutes_each = 15;
  total_number_of_experiments * minutes_each / 60 / 24
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] 22.5

_C++ Comparison Analysis_

- Version
  - Ayira
  - pajeng with flex
  - pajeng without flex
- Input size
- 30 replications

|------------+---------|
| Input Size | Version |
|------------+---------|

_Changes to the *mysql* plugin_
- add a new parameter to tell the batch size (default is size of input)
- add a flag (disable by default) to tell the plugin to measure each batch execution
  - a vector will be used to keep this in memory during execution;
    only at the end that this is dumped to CSV
  - generates a new file that has the CSV info in the beggining of
    each line and then the following information you have measured
  |--------------+------------+----------+---------------+------------------------------|
  | Batch number | Start time | End time | Size in bytes | Size in number of operations |
  |--------------+------------+----------+---------------+------------------------------|

_How to measure memory utilization_
- MemoryUsage class in Java, check the used() method
- Compare against top (the column that indicates the virtual memory allocated)
* 2016-03-29 DoE for C++ Comparison                                   :Lucas:

The C++ Comparison has two factors: _version_ and _input_, each one with
three levels. For version, the levels are _ayira_, _pj_, _pjflex_. For
input, the levels are small (128K), medium (131072K, or 128M), and big
(1048576K or 1G). We shall use 30 replications randomizing experiments
to reduce external interference. Two things are measured: the
execution time represents the _simulation time_, the _platform_ is the
identification of the platform where measurements took place. Platform
can be one of _luiza_, _guarani_, _orion_, _hptais_ (TODO: rename this last one).

To understand what functions below do, check:
- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DoE.base/DoE.base.pdf
You'll need the =DoE.base= R package.

#+begin_src R :results output silent :session :exports none
  require(DoE.base);
  Cpp_Comparison <- fac.design (
           nfactors=2,
           replications=30,
           repeat.only=FALSE,
           blocks=1,
           randomize=TRUE,
           seed=10373,
           nlevels=c(3,3),
           factor.names=list(
                version=c("aiyra","pj","pjflex"),
                input=c("small", "medium", "big")));

  export.design(Cpp_Comparison,
                path="designs",
                filename=NULL,
                type="csv",
                replace=TRUE,
                response.names=c("time","platform"));
#+end_src

Check the file =Cpp_Comparison.csv= in the =designs= directory. It
contains your experimental design for running the Cpp Comparison
experimental session. Each line is a experiment. You should run each
experiment following the factor configuration, providing the execution
time in the last column.

You can read that CSV with:

#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
csv <- read.csv("designs/Cpp_Comparison.csv");
csv;
#+end_src

* 2016-03-29 DoE for Batch Size Investigation                         :Lucas:

The batch size investigation will have two factors: _input_, and
_batch_. The first one with three levels, the second one with six
levels. The levels for input are small (128K), medium (131072K, or
128M), and big (1048576K or 1G). The levels for batch are A, B, C, D,
E and F. Each letter is a integer number which represents the number
of SQL operations in each batch. Based on preliminary runs, Tais will
decide which values to use instead of letters A to F. I'll use them so
it's easy to map them to values once they are defined. We shall again
use 30 replications randomizing experiments to reduce external
interference. Four things are measured: the global simulation time
(all time except DB insertions), the global insertion time (the sum of
the time spent executing all DB insertions - the batches), the maximum
memory occupation during the experiment, and the platform.  Platform
can be one of _luiza_, _guarani_, _orion_, _hptais_ (TODO: rename this last
one). The memory occupation should be measure with exception care,
since the _maximum_ may not appear at the end of the execution,
specially if batches are small.

* 2016-03-29 Tracing batch executions along time                      :Lucas:

This follows the same design as in:
- [[*2016-03-29 Tracing batch executions along time][2016-03-29 Tracing batch executions along time]]

The difference is that =ayira= should be instrumented to measure, at _the
end of every batch execution_, the following information:

# Design factors
- input (see [[*2016-03-29 DoE for Batch Size Investigation][2016-03-29 DoE for Batch Size Investigation]])
- batch (see [[*2016-03-29 DoE for Batch Size Investigation][2016-03-29 DoE for Batch Size Investigation]])
# Tracing info
- batch number (starting at 1)
- start time (in microseconds)
- end time (in microseconds)
- size in bytes of the batch
- size in number of operations
# Platform
- Platform

Ideally, each line holds all this information. Note that there might
be many of these lines since it gets registered at every batch
execution, specially when size is 128 operations and file is big. So,
I strongly recommend you buffer this information in a vector and dump
only at the end. The name of the file should be something unique,
combining information above, such as =input_batch_platform.csv=, where
input is big/medium/small, batch is A, B, C and so on. You could use
all columns values as in the design described in [[*2016-03-29 DoE for Batch Size Investigation][2016-03-29 DoE for
Batch Size Investigation]] except for those that you measure (simulation
and insertion times, memory utilization).
* 2016-03-31 Adding the Batch Size manipulation                        :Tais:
** Implementation
- New argument to "mysql" plugin: -batch <max_size> 
  - size is in number of operations, not bytes.
- We have 4 different types of batches, but it is all counted as it
  was one.

** Batch information data structure
- It is a Map<Long, Long[]>, where the key is the time when the batch
  was executed.
- There is no option of finding out the batch size in bytes.
- Key: start time. Value: end time, duration, size in operations
  - size in operations is always the same, but the last one, that will
    be what is left.


* 2016-04-01 Meeting with Tais (Scripts)                         :Lucas:Tais:

Batch size is measured in two ways:
- number of operations
- in bytes (doubt below)

How to measure the batch size in bytes?
- Count the number of bytes in prepared statements
- Count the number of bytes when customizing statements
- Sum everything to reach the number of bytes for each batch

Problem measuring =memory= utilization in Java. Let's do like this:
- Before each batch execution, we measure the amount of memory in
  bytes like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() - Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory())
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- The result is compared against a global =maxMemory= variable. It the
  results is greated, we update =maxMemory=, otherwise we do nothing.
- Doing this we will obtain the maximum memory utilization of the
  program, which we can use to run comparisons according to the
  batch size. We are not sure yet about the resolution of such
  functions, so let's use the data with care.

Measuring time in nanoseconds _for everything_
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
System.nanoTime();
#+END_EXAMPLE

Execution time (OKAY)
- Should not consider time spent for DB connection

Print batch size (the argument) to the output
- When no batch is provided, you print the initilization's MAXINT 

_What is missing for launching the experiments?_
- Three input files
- Bash script to run the experiment
  - INPUT: CSV design
  - OUTPUT: CSV design with measurements

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both :tangle Cpp_Comparison.sh

Until Tuesday, you sent me both scripts.
Next Friday, we analyze some data.


* 2016-04-01 Generating traces with different sizes                   :Lucas:

For input, the levels are small (128K), medium (131072K, or 128M), and
big (1048576K or 1G). So, to generate these files, you can use an
example tool called tracegen that I just developed with poti. To
quickly introduce yourself, do:

_Clone and Compile_

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both
git clone https://github.com/schnorr/poti.git
mkdir -p poti/build; cd poti/build
cmake ..; make VERBOSE=yes
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

_Get to know tracegen_

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both
./poti/build/examples/tracegen --help
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

As you can see you just have to provide an obligatory filename and an
optional target size. If size is not provided, it will generate the
minimal trace file for this example (see tracegen source code [1] for
details).

[1]: https://github.com/schnorr/poti/blob/master/examples/tracegen.c

_Generating the trace files_

So, to get you trace files, just run the following:

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both
./poti/build/examples/tracegen --filename trace-128K.paje --size `echo 128*1024 | bc -l`
./poti/build/examples/tracegen --filename trace-128M.paje --size `echo 128*1024*1024 | bc -l`
./poti/build/examples/tracegen --filename trace-1G.paje --size `echo 1024*1024*1024 | bc -l`
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Great. Let's it. I'm gzipping them to send to you.

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both
gzip trace-128K.paje trace-128M.paje trace-1G.paje; ls -lh *.paje.gz
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: -rw-r--r-- 1 schnorr schnorr  40K Apr  1 16:51 trace-128K.paje.gz
: -rw-r--r-- 1 schnorr schnorr  36M Apr  1 16:51 trace-128M.paje.gz
: -rw-r--r-- 1 schnorr schnorr 277M Apr  1 16:52 trace-1G.paje.gz

- Three input files OK
- Bash script to run the experiment
  - INPUT: CSV design
  - OUTPUT: CSV design with measurements
* 2016-04-04 - Bash Scripts
** Cpp_Comparison:
- need -t parameter

-Mac: max number for "big" exceeds gc overhead limit

* 2016-04-05 - Mac pj_dump
- CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.

Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:

FL_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)

    linked by target "paje_library" in directory
   
This happens beacause the ccmake . is not finding the Flex file libfl.a

If you installed Flex using Brew:
brew list flex 
find the path to the "lib" folder: THIS will be the path to the
missing file. 
Go to ccmake . 
find FL_LIBRARY
put the path , adding libfl.a at the end

Let's plot this with a simple plot.

Learn =ggplot2=:
- http://ggplot2.org/

How to install gpplot2:

#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
install.packages("ggplot2");
#+end_src

Let's finally plot.

(Literate Programming)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file img/first_plot_1.png :exports both :width 600 :height 400 :session
library(ggplot2);
ggplot(k, aes(x=version, y=time_avg, color=input)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=time_avg-time_se, ymax=time_avg+time_se), width=.1) +
  theme_bw() + ylim(0, NA);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/first_plot_1.png]]

Strange, CPP is much slower for =big= and =medium=. A possible explanation
is that =aiyra= keeps a minimum memory footprint, while the cpp version
buffers everything (but do not dump at the end). So, execution times
of =pj= and =pjflex= considers all the burden of allocating memory.

Let's plot again using bars.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file img/first_plot_2.png  :exports both :width 600 :height 400 :session
library(ggplot2);
ggplot(k, aes(x=version, fill=time_avg)) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge") +
#  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=time_avg-time_se, ymax=time_avg+time_se), width=.1) +
  theme_bw() + ylim(0, NA);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/first_plot_2.png]]

Didn't work, to be improved.

Let's look to the other batch size data.

But that has some strange errors, see:

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both

We are surprised by these results, again:
- insertion time is stable no matter the batch size
- simulation time reduces when batch size is smaller
  - Overhead of the garbage collector
  - Everything is being in kept in memory

Specific to the insert database plugin.

Hypothesis:
- few bigger batches leads to more performance
  - but with preliminary results we have seen that makes no difference
    to have many small batches than few bigger batches. At the end,
    few bigger batches have worse performance than lots of smaller
    batches because since they are small, their memory footprint is
    also small.

Let's see if that conclusion holds.

#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
library(dplyr);
k <- df %>%
     group_by(input, batch, platform) %>%
     summarize(N = n(),
               sim_time_avg = mean(sim_time),
               insert_time_avg = mean(insert_time),
               max_mem_avg = mean(max_mem),
               sim_time_se = 3*sd(sim_time)/sqrt(N),
               insert_time_se = 3*sd(insert_time)/sqrt(N),
               max_mem_se = 3*sd(max_mem)/sqrt(N)) %>%
     as.data.frame();

You have to explain the larger variability during the =luiza=, =pj=,
=big=. Maybe because something was disturbing the experiment during that
time. But remember we have randomize the design, so, it should have
affected other configurations as well.

You can see a =300= seconds measurement that probably is the explanation
for the higher standard error. We don't know, we could remove it, but
you can keep it and explain with something. Maybe mention that is
unrelated, because the experimental execution order was 12 for this
one..., with the other outlier you have seen also in =luiza= (see
above).

Ok.

Aiyra wins for big and medium. What about small? We can't see, let's
do a plot only about it.

It's different for small. Maybe it should be interesting to plot in
the graph the three inputs, so we can see the different trend for
small.

Great, Tais will write in the text that she explains all three first
plots, then to show the different trend, she uses =local_all_inputs_v1=
plot.

For =remote=, guarani had aiyra; orion1 had the database. Tais will
check the scripts to confirm and check since this is very important.

So, since =guarani= was involved, let's compare =remote= agains it because
it means we took out the database from guarani and put in another
machine (in this case =orion=). The objective of our analysis here is to
see the network impact in the execution comparing with a situation
where everything resides in the same machine.

Future work idea:
- create a producer/consumer version where insert requests are put in
  a queue; another thread will be responsible for insertion. We could
  implement another plugin that is threaded.

So, let's take only =guarani= and =remote= measurements.

Great, finally.

Let's read the =batch_traces.csv= with R.

#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
df <- read.csv ("results/batch_time/batch_traces.csv");
df$start = df$start / 1000000;
df$end = df$end / 1000000;
